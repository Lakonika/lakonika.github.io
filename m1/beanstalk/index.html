					<p>Fairy tales are stories that have got characters such as fairies, witches, princesses and giants in them and often talking animals, too. They are often full of magic and sometimes mixed with real history.</p>
					<p>A fairy tale starts as a story people tell each other. Every time someone tells it, the story gets longer and better because they add a little bit each time to make it more exciting or scary.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Fairy tales come from all over the world and pass from generation to generation. Sometimes there are a few different versions of the same story going around at the same time. Then one day, someone writes it down and that is the story that
						everyone remembers.</p>
					<p>The oldest written fairy tales come from Ancient Egypt around 1500 BC but there may be much older ones that aren't written down.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>We have got so many well-known fairy tales today thanks to storytellers like the Brothers Grimm. We can also thank others who put together the many wonderful tales in the Mother Goose collection.</p>
					<p>Today's fairy tales are not as scary as those from long ago, but they are still great stories and lots of fun to read.</p>

					<p>"Wake up, Jack! You must help me. There is nothing to eat for breakfast this morning. We haven't got any food. Our cupboard is empty. We can't buy any food because we haven't got any money. You must go to the market and sell Daisy and buy
